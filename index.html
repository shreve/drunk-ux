        The best tool for a fresh perspective: <em>Alcohol</em>.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Who?</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://jacobevanshreve.me" title="Jacob Evan Shreve">Jacob Shreve</a>. I'm a freelance programmer and designer, and a
          student at <abbr title="The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor">UMich</abbr>.
          I've made and used a lot of websites, and I like to complain about bad user experience often.</dd>

        <dt>What?</dt>
        <dd>I will get really drunk and attempt to use your website. While I look around, I'll record a screencast and detail to you any UX issues I find.
          Of course, editing a video and preparing a quality deliverable takes some time, so I won't be drunk for the whole production,
          just the testing period and screencast recording.</dd>

        <dt>When?</dt>
        <dd>The Monday following your payment. Getting a high enough
          <abbr title="Blood Alcohol Content">BAC</abbr> to properly test a website is usually a bit too much drinking for a week night.
          I prefer to make these screencasts as a weekend project.</dd>


        <dt>Where?</dt>
        <dd>I live in Ypsilanti, MI, but that doesn't really matter. We can arrange things via email, and I'll post the screencast here once it's done.</dd>

        <dt>Why?</dt>
        <dd>
          Usability testing is very much about qualitative data, but improving your site's user experience can have very real, quantitative results.
          These tests can uncover difficult or confusing parts of your site you weren't even aware of, or even ones you couldn't find yourself.
          Think of it like Drano&reg; for your sales funnel.
        </dd>

        <dt>How Much?</dt>
        <dd vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="Offer">
          <meta property="priceCurrency" content="USD" />
          <span property="price" content="200">$200</span> per site. If you pay a little extra for the bottle, you can choose what I drink.
